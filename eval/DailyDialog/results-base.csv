And all the dishes should not be eaten up completely .

"[SOC][USER] come on , nothing can be that bad . [SYSTEM] but promise me , you'll keep it a secret . [USER] ok , I promise . So what's troubling you so much ? [EOC]",[SYSTEM] I've fallen in love with my boss . ,[SOR][SYSTEM] do you have any memory of our first date?

[EOC]","[SYSTEM] worse still , he is trying to avoid me these days . ","[SOR][SYSTEM] yes, and sometimes the main point is the insinuation that we are dirty or pettish.

"[SOC][USER] oh , I see . Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip . [SYSTEM] worse still , he is trying to avoid me these days . [USER] office romance is very tricky . [EOC]",[SYSTEM] it gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed . ,[SOR][SYSTEM] how dare you write such a threatening letter to me? I can't stand his criticism.

Hear me out , just this once , Isabella ! ",[SOR][SYSTEM] Be careful. I'm pretty sure my foot hurts. Have you ever been on that road before? 
"[SOC][USER] How dare you ! ( starts to walk off ) [SYSTEM] Hang on one second . Hear me out , just this once , Isabella ! [USER] Why did you lie to me in the email ? [EOC]",[SYSTEM] I didn't lie . You just didn't ask me my real name . ,"[SOR][SYSTEM] I meant to, But... I didn't Sit down! "

I would rather have a down-to-earth , honest and solid sales person than a painted , patent leather , designer suite salesman . [USER] It's not as simple as that . People judge you by your appearance , whether you like it or not . So dressing professional is being professional . The image that you portray to others is so important in business . It's your image and how others perceive you that makes the difference between landing or losing a sale . [EOC]","[SYSTEM] Maybe you're right , but I'll take my sneakers and jeans any day ! ","[SOR][SYSTEM] I think you should do some research. Check everybody else's clothing and looks online to see if they may be competitive. Some are wearing designer clothes at interviews, some wear blue jeans that are either too casual or too stylish."

"[SOC][USER] It's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned ? [SYSTEM] You're right , but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering .

"[SOC][USER]Hey Kevin , what are you doing here ? Don't you usually spend Tuesday nights at home studying ? [SYSTEM] I needed to get out of the house . My parents just went ballistic over something my older sister told them . [USER] What did she tell them ? Is she dropping out of college ? [EOC]",[SYSTEM] Nothing that serious . She finally told them that she moved out of the dormitory a few months ago and has been living with her boyfriend . ,"[SOR][SYSTEM] Well, it seems like she might have some regrets about that. She knows how hard it is working. And it's hard to decide... "
[SOC][USER] What did she tell them ? Is she dropping out of college ? [SYSTEM] Nothing that serious . She finally told them that she moved out of the dormitory a few months ago and has been living with her boyfriend . [USER] And your parents took it badly ? [EOC],[SYSTEM] That's putting it mildly . My father started shouting at my sister and my mother just glared at her . ,"[SOR][SYSTEM] In no way. And Miles was the same, though much harder. "
"[SOC][USER] And your parents took it badly ? [SYSTEM] That's putting it mildly . My father started shouting at my sister and my mother just glared at her . [USER] Ouch , that sounds bad . What did your sister do ? [EOC]","[SYSTEM] She started arguing back to my dad that how much she loves her boyfriend , how they're in love and it's not hurting anybody , and so on . My dad said she's too young to do this , and that she should move out right away . ",[SOR][SYSTEM] She was really getting mad at my husband. She called him a put-up queen.

[SOC][USER] How long has your sister been with her boyfriend ? [SYSTEM] Three years . They've been dating since freshman year . They're even talking about marriage . [USER] Really ? Then I guess living together would be a good idea . [EOC],[SYSTEM] What do you mean ? ,"[SOR][SYSTEM] True, but the longer the better. "
"[SOC][USER] Really ? Then I guess living together would be a good idea . [SYSTEM] What do you mean ? [USER] Well , these days too many people are getting divorced . If they live together , then at least they're finding out if they're really compatible or not . [EOC]","[SYSTEM] I guess so . Better to find out now than after you're married , when it's harder to get out . ",[SOR][SYSTEM] And what happens to your child if you live with someone else together? 
"[SOC][USER]Do you think they two will get married ? [SYSTEM] Yeah , you can count on it . [USER] I think so . Yes , they get along so well . [EOC]",[SYSTEM] I like him . He's good for her . ,"[SOR][SYSTEM] Well, let's arrive at a perfect and sincere marriage. "
[SOC][USER]What do you think of Frank ? [SYSTEM] He is all right . But I think he seems to have no back bone . [USER] Why do you say that ? [EOC],"[SYSTEM] Whatever things get tough , he gives in . ",[SOR][SYSTEM] He has made a career out of it.

Then she has to repeat what she said . ,[SOR][SYSTEM] No. It's the easy way. Most English students just speak French in class. But a few Frenchmen and a few Japanese stand in the background. 
[SOC][USER] I suppose she's right . Does she speak English very slowly ? [SYSTEM] Not always . Sometimes we don't understand her . Then she has to repeat what she said . [USER] It must be interesting to study English . [EOC],[SYSTEM] Mario and I are the best students in the class . Miss.Parker says that my pronunciation is very good . ,[SOR][SYSTEM] Not really. I already know what she's like. I'm sure you will like it. 
[SOC][USER] It must be interesting to study English . [SYSTEM] Mario and I are the best students in the class . Miss.Parker says that my pronunciation is very good . [USER] Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ? [EOC],[SYSTEM] Sometimes it's difficult . Some words look different from the way one pronounces them . ,"[SOR][SYSTEM] It depends.

"[SOC][USER] true . The news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities . [SYSTEM] definitely . I have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month .

[SOC][USER] yes . The government has banned price hikes in some key industries like energy . [SYSTEM] but I'm afraid the price hikes will spill over from food into other areas of the economy .

[EOC],[SYSTEM] Yeah . we never do that in a public office . ,"[SOR][SYSTEM] Yes, it makes sense to do so. When I am working in a crowded office, I find it hard to get in touch with each other. "
[SOC][USER] That makes you feel uncomfortable ? [SYSTEM] Yeah . we never do that in a public office . [USER] Perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy .
