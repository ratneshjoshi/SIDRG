"[SOC][USER]Mrs . Wang , would you give us an idea of the price you regard as workable ? [SYSTEM] As I said before , your price is so high that we find it difficult to make a bid . We hope you will take the initiative and bridge the gap . [USER] Just to comply , we're ready to reduce the price by 5 percent . I hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling . [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] So do we . Certainly it's a step forward on your side . But the gap is still too wide . [EOR]"
"[SOC][USER] Just to comply , we're ready to reduce the price by 5 percent . I hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling . [SYSTEM] So do we . Certainly it's a step forward on your side . But the gap is still too wide . [USER] The ball is in your court , Mrs.Wang . What price would you suggest ? [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] To make your offer workable , I think you should take another step down as big as the one you've just taken . [EOR]"
"[SOC][USER] The ball is in your court , Mrs.Wang . What price would you suggest ? [SYSTEM] To make your offer workable , I think you should take another step down as big as the one you've just taken . [USER] That won't do . You see , our profit margin is very narrow .

Do think it over , please . We sincerely hope our discussion will come to a successful conclusion . [EOR]"

Shall we meet again , say , on Friday morning ? [EOR]"

You should have one every year . [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] I know . I figure as long as there is nothing wrong , why go see the doctor ? [EOR]"
"[SOC][USER] Yes , well , you haven't had one for 5 years . You should have one every year . [SYSTEM] I know . I figure as long as there is nothing wrong , why go see the doctor ?

We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at nine pm . [USER] How long does it take to get there ? [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] About twelve hours .

Twelve hours is such a long time ! [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] Yes , of course . There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times . We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers . [EOR]"
"[SOC][USER] Yeah , I think that is the best option . Do you serve food on the train ? Twelve hours is such a long time ! [SYSTEM] Yes , of course . There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times . We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers . [USER] Great ! I ’ ll take it .

[SOC][USER]I would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend . [SYSTEM] A trip to the beach would be fun . How is the weather going to be ? [USER] The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend . [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach ? [EOR]
[SOC][USER] The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend . [SYSTEM] So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach ? [USER] It sounds like it will be . [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] I really hope it doesn't get cold . [EOR]
"[SOC][USER] It sounds like it will be . [SYSTEM] I really hope it doesn't get cold . [USER] That would ruin things , I want to go so badly . [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] The weather in California is unpredictable , so you never know . [EOR]"

"[SOC][USER]Some companies use to ban dating among employees , but now they have realized it is something in avertable . People spend so much time at work . It is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other . [SYSTEM] If we think positively , office love can be beneficial to company . [USER] Beneficial ? I don ’ t think so . If two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . If they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . By any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating . [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] But if two employees are in love , they will be happy . Happy people are more productive . If they develop an intimate relation with each other , they are willing to share knowledge and experience . It can help to improve work efficiency . [EOR]"
"[SOC][USER]Do you eat a lot of healthy food ? [SYSTEM] Compared with healthy food , unhealthy food just tastes so much better . And anyway , I believe if you live a low stress Life and are active , you can get away with eating whatever you like . It's all in the mind . [USER] You have the point . I think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume . Some good things you should try are cranberry juice , wild rice and yoghurt . [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] What's special about these things ? [EOR]"
"[SOC][USER] You have the point . I think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume . Some good things you should try are cranberry juice , wild rice and yoghurt . [SYSTEM] What's special about these things ? [USER] Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic . Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice . Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled . [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] Thanks . I'm going to follow your advice and pop down to the supermarket right now . [EOR]"
"[SOC][USER]I've been so tired recently . I've been trying , but I don't think I'm up to this job . [SYSTEM] You need to take a break , maybe a vacation . [USER] Oh , yes , indeed .

"[SOC][USER] Yes , I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on . [SYSTEM] Have you decided ? [USER] Yes . I want to get a better job . [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] Could you tell me why you want to quit ? [EOR]"
"[SOC][USER] Yes . I want to get a better job . [SYSTEM] Could you tell me why you want to quit ? [USER] I quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues . [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] Oh , that's terrible . Do you want to get a higher salary in our company ? [EOR]"
"[SOC][USER] I quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues . [SYSTEM] Oh , that's terrible . Do you want to get a higher salary in our company ? [USER] I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We'll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay . [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] OK , I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you . However , I think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay . [EOR]"
"[SOC][USER] I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We'll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay . [SYSTEM] OK , I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you .

"[SOC][USER]So , how should we get to the theatre ? [SYSTEM] Let's take the bus . [USER] I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you . [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] It's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once . [EOR]"
"[SOC][USER] I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you . [SYSTEM] It's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once . [USER] It wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus . [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] We could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice . [EOR]"
"[SOC][USER] It wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus . [SYSTEM] We could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice . [USER] Train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too . [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] If we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ? [EOR]"
"[SOC][USER] Train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too . [SYSTEM] If we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ?

"[SOC][USER]Let's go over this plan again . [SYSTEM] From Vancouver , we bike along the border all the way to Winnipeg . [USER] And that is mostly flat , right ? [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] Relatively , once we're out of Alberta , anyway . Then it's hills again in Aitoba . [EOR]"
"[SOC][USER] And that is mostly flat , right ? [SYSTEM] Relatively , once we're out of Alberta , anyway . Then it's hills again in Aitoba .

"[SOC][USER] And from Winnipeg we go around the lakes through Toronto , right ? [SYSTEM] That's right . And up in to Quebec . And that's where we stop .

[SYSTEM] But you must take the quality into consideration . Everyone in the trade knows that US ’ s bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries . [USER] I agree that yours are of better quality . But there ’ s competition from synthetic products , too . You can ’ t very well ignore that . Prices for synthetic bristles haven ’ t changed much over the years . [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] There ’ s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses . That ’ s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones . To be frank with you , if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us , we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price . [EOR]"

That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . [EOR]"
