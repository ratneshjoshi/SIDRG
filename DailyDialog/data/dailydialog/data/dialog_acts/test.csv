First of all , it ’ s very important for you not to be late .

[dialog_acts]commissive[EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] So you ’ d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing .

"[SOC][USER] Yeah , that's very important .

"[SOC][USER] I ’ ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer . [dialog_acts]commissive[SYSTEM] That ’ s right . You need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes . [dialog_acts]directive[USER] It ’ s always easier to say something than to do it . [dialog_acts]commissive[EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] It ’ s not too difficult to make a good impression . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications . [EOR]"

[dialog_acts]commissive[EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview .

"[SOC][USER] I know what you mean . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time . [dialog_acts]commissive[SYSTEM] You got it . Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement . [dialog_acts]directive[USER] It seems that ' clothes make the man ' .

"[SOC][USER]So tell me , what's the difference between the Board of Directors , the CEO , and the stockholders ? They all seems ot be the same group of people to me ...

Conventionally , before the meal starts , the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one . Others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite . Toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other .
