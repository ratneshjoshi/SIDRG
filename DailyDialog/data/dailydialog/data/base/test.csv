"[SOC][USER]Hi , George . I'm going to have a job interview next week . Could you give me some advice ? [SYSTEM] Sure . First of all , it ’ s very important for you not to be late . Job interviewers usually don ’ t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic . [USER] Yeah , that's very important . [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] So you ’ d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment . [EOR]"
"[SOC][USER] Yeah , that's very important . [SYSTEM] So you ’ d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment . [USER] I ’ ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer . [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] That ’ s right . You need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes . [EOR]"
"[SOC][USER] I ’ ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer . [SYSTEM] That ’ s right . You need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes . [USER] It ’ s always easier to say something than to do it . [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] It ’ s not too difficult to make a good impression . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications . [EOR]"

For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style .

[EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview .

Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous . [EOR]"
"[SOC][USER] It ’ s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes . [SYSTEM] You misunderstood me .

I ought to wear right clothes at the right time . [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] You got it . Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement . [EOR]"
"[SOC][USER] I know what you mean . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time . [SYSTEM] You got it . Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement . [USER] It seems that ' clothes make the man ' . [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] It may not be true , but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior . [EOR]"

"[SOC][USER]So tell me , what's the difference between the Board of Directors , the CEO , and the stockholders ? They all seems ot be the same group of people to me ...

[USER] How many people are on the board of directors ? [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] Usually not more than 15 , not less than 10 .

"[SOC][USER] That ’ s very good . I once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful . [SYSTEM] What was so bad about it ? [USER] Small rooms , small window , a small desk shared by three people . I would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work . [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] Sounds bad ! Lucky you ! You didn ’ t take that job . I think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently . [EOR]"

"[SOC][USER]Want to send out for some Chinese ? [SYSTEM] Some what ? [USER] Some Chinese food . I'm hungry , and there's a take-out restaurant near here . We can have them deliver and then watch the news on TV while we eat . [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] No , I'd rather go out . The Chinese food here is rather different from what I had at home .

"[SOC][USER]Hello , Sir . So , you are back ? [SYSTEM] Yes , hello again . I would like to know the exact difference between Dividend Deposit and Dividend Participated Deposit . [USER] That's pretty easy to explain . With the Deposit , the interest is fixed , but the Dividend of each policy will be transferred automatically into your bank account by the end of each year . The longer the term , the higher the Dividend you earn . This is because it is calculated at the Compound Interest Rate . [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] And I can purchase that here ? [EOR]"

"[SOC][USER]The last thing to be ignored at a Chinese dinner table is to keep modest . [SYSTEM] Does that suggest diners avoid speaking much ? The same is true in the West . [USER] No , absolutely not ! On the contrary , you'll be considered a well-connected , sociable man , if you keep involved in the conversation all the time . But always pay attention to what you say . If the table has a senior guest , say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible . Or maybe , you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested . [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] You mean , keeping a low profile in the presence of the old ?

Or maybe , you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested . [SYSTEM] You mean , keeping a low profile in the presence of the old ? That goes in like with Confucius ' preachings , right ? [USER] Correct . Show respect for the older people . Conventionally , before the meal starts , the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one . Others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite . Toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other . [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] Any other rules to observe in order to keep modest ? [EOR]"

[SYSTEM] Any other rules to observe in order to keep modest ? [USER] Yes , plenty of them . Don't eat fast ! People usually keep their dining pace accorded with others . And all the dishes should not be eaten up completely . [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] Is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient ? [EOR]"
"[SOC][USER]Our toner cartridges are already out of ink ... Could you make an order for a new set ? [SYSTEM] We will need new cartridges for all of the office printers ? That will be a large order , probably about two or three cases . The office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock . [USER] You can double check with the housekeeping department , but I am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges . Last time when we made our order to the supplier , the quantity was also especially high . They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us . As long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance , they can usually fill the order . [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] OK , I will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure . Is there anything else we need to order while I am at it ? [EOR]"

We should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis . Anyhow , see what you can do to expedite the order this time . [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] OK , will do . [EOR]"

"[SOC][USER]A friend of mine has been taking an online career planning course these days . He told me the other day he has learned a lot from it . He recommended me to subscribe to it . What do you say ? [SYSTEM] I think it is good if we know enough about career planning . We will make wiser choices . What else did he tell you about it ? [USER] Well , just something in general , like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals . [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] Sounds practical ! To be honest , sometimes I feel puzzled about my future career . I am not sure if this job suits me the best though I work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker .

I have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills . [USER] Making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do . It seems that you need this course more than I do . I love my current job . If I take this course , I hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work . If they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships , that will be great . I need these to improve my current work performance .

[SOC][USER] How will I know what the numbers mean ? [SYSTEM] You can see your results and how they compare to the normal range . [USER] How can I see test results from tests I have taken before ? [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] We put all of your test results up in the same place . Just check the dates for what you need . [EOR]
"[SOC][USER]This is our rock-bottom price , Mr . Lee . [SYSTEM] If that's the case . there's not much point in further discussion . We might as well call the whole deal off . [USER] What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price . The gap is too great . [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] I think it unwise for either of us to be inflexible . How about meeting each other halfway ? [EOR]"
"[SOC][USER] What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price . The gap is too great . [SYSTEM] I think it unwise for either of us to be inflexible . How about meeting each other halfway ? [USER] What's your proposal ? [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] Your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we want . Well , I suggest we meet each other halfway . [EOR]"
"[SOC][USER] What's your proposal ? [SYSTEM] Your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we want . Well , I suggest we meet each other halfway . [USER] Do you mean a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? That's impossible ! [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] What would you suggest ? [EOR]"
[SOC][USER] Do you mean a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? That's impossible ! [SYSTEM] What would you suggest ? [USER] The best we can do is another 30 dollars off . That's definitely the lowest we can go . [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] That still leaves a gap of 20 dollars . Let's meet each other half-away again and split the difference ; I think this is a price we can both be satisfied with . [EOR]

[SOC][USER] Look at that . It's so dangerous . My mom would never allow me to do that . [SYSTEM] Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show . [USER] You are right . But what if an avalanche happened ? [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] They are all great skiers and very experienced . So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim . [EOR]
"[SOC][USER] You are right . But what if an avalanche happened ? [SYSTEM] They are all great skiers and very experienced . So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .

"[SOC][USER]Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ? [SYSTEM] Of course ! It is the No . 1 stressor in my life . You know job stress has become a very common problem these days . So we must learn to cope with it . [USER] Totally agree . What is your solution ? [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy . [EOR]"

"[SOC][USER] You seem to have a very relaxed outlook . [SYSTEM] It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress . [USER] But I don ’ t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses . [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . Our boss is a smart person . He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team . [EOR]"

I hear there's a place in Chinatown where you can take some courses . Are you interested ? [USER] I'm not sure . I don't enjoy cooking that much . As long as we can order it from a restaurant , we don't have to learn to do it by ourselves . [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] You are right . But I just want to know how they prepare food and make it taste so different . [EOR]"

"[SOC][USER] Can you tell me about it ? [SYSTEM] You know , sometimes patients can get very unreasonable . They may insist they are sick when they are not . [USER] What can you do when this happens ? [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] Not much , usually I'll just keep silent . [EOR]"

[USER] I don ’ t think you do.If you did , I ’ d have a car.See , you know how to take the reservation , you just don ’ t know how to hold the reservation and that ’ s really the most important part of the reservation , the holding . Anybody can just take them . [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] But we do have a compact or an SUV if you ’ d like . [EOR]"
"[SOC][USER] I don ’ t think you do.If you did , I ’ d have a car.See , you know how to take the reservation , you just don ’ t know how to hold the reservation and that ’ s really the most important part of the reservation , the holding .

"[SOC][USER]I met a girl in elevator this morning . She works in a company upstairs . She said she envied the casual way we dress for work . She complained about the dress rule in her company . It requires everyone to wear formal clothes from Monday to Friday . [SYSTEM] Well , I was wondering where those people with professional attire come from . Now , I know the answer . [USER] You know , in a sense , a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in July , and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees . Even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule , isn ’ t that strict ? [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] To some extent , it is . Anyway , whether they like it or not , they do give people a very good impression . [EOR]"

What kind of drugs was he using ? [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] He was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster . [EOR]"
[SOC][USER] What ? What kind of drugs was he using ? [SYSTEM] He was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster . [USER] I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs . [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] They are . The only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards . [EOR]
"[SOC][USER] I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs . [SYSTEM] They are . The only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards . [USER] That's so disappointing .

"[SOC][USER]Cindy , how come nearly all the prime-time TV shows are comedies ? [SYSTEM] That's because Americans love sitcoms . [USER] Sitcoms ? [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] Situation comedies .

The same events never happen twice , do they ? [EOR]"
"[SOC][USER] Some people say that history repeats itself . [SYSTEM] What does that mean ? The same events never happen twice , do they ?

"[SOC][USER]Hello , Daisy , how are you doing ? [SYSTEM] Fine , thank you . I haven ’ t seen you for quite some time . What have you been up to recently ?

"[SOC][USER] I have been spending a lot of time watching movies at home , so you wouldn't have seen me . Recently , I've been obsessed with horror films .

"[SOC][USER] Yeah , you are right I used to not watch horror films , but after seeing Silence of the Lamb with Mike last month , I fell in love with them . [SYSTEM] It's amazing . But if I were you , I wouldn't have the courage to watch the first one . [USER] But it's really exciting .

"[SOC][USER]It's hard to be optimistic about things with the way the economy's headed ... The trade deficit is getting larger , consumption's down , I really think we're headed for a recession . [SYSTEM] The economy has been stagnant for a while now . We've been in a recessive state for several months already . What worries me the most is the trade deficit . I think the government should do more to encourage exports . [USER] Increasing exports would weaken the currency . I think the main point is economic growth . We need more jobs . Factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries . The result is an increase in unemployment in our own country , lower consumption , lower production , and an overall feeble economy . If more people are working , it will give the economy a boost . [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] It's true that we should do something about unemployment , but what about inflation ? If unemployment falls , there's pressure to increase pay . That would result in inflation , which would result in a much less dynamic economy . [EOR]"

"[SOC][USER] Why did you lie to me in the email ? [SYSTEM] I didn't lie . You just didn't ask me my real name . [USER] I should have known it was you .

I would rather have a down-to-earth , honest and solid sales person than a painted , patent leather , designer suite salesman . [USER] It's not as simple as that . People judge you by your appearance , whether you like it or not . So dressing professional is being professional . The image that you portray to others is so important in business . It's your image and how others perceive you that makes the difference between landing or losing a sale . [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] Maybe you're right , but I'll take my sneakers and jeans any day ! [EOR]"

"[SOC][USER] And your parents took it badly ? [SYSTEM] That's putting it mildly . My father started shouting at my sister and my mother just glared at her . [USER] Ouch , that sounds bad . What did your sister do ? [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] She started arguing back to my dad that how much she loves her boyfriend , how they're in love and it's not hurting anybody , and so on .

"[SOC][USER] Really ? Then I guess living together would be a good idea . [SYSTEM] What do you mean ? [USER] Well , these days too many people are getting divorced . If they live together , then at least they're finding out if they're really compatible or not . [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] I guess so . Better to find out now than after you're married , when it's harder to get out . [EOR]"
"[SOC][USER]Do you think they two will get married ? [SYSTEM] Yeah , you can count on it . [USER] I think so . Yes , they get along so well . [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] I like him . He's good for her . [EOR]"
"[SOC][USER]What do you think of Frank ? [SYSTEM] He is all right . But I think he seems to have no back bone . [USER] Why do you say that ? [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] Whatever things get tough , he gives in . [EOR]"
"[SOC][USER]Do you speak only English in the class , or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish ? [SYSTEM] Oh , we never speak Spanish in class ! Miss.Parker speaks to us only in English . [USER] I suppose she's right . Does she speak English very slowly ? [EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] Not always . Sometimes we don't understand her . Then she has to repeat what she said . [EOR]"
