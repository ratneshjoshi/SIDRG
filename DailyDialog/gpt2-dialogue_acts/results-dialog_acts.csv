However, acquaintance relationships often end happily. "
"[SOC][USER] oh , I see . Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip . [dialog_acts]inform[SYSTEM] worse still , he is trying to avoid me these days . [dialog_acts]inform[USER] office romance is very tricky . [dialog_acts]inform[EOC]",[SYSTEM] it gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed . ,"[SOR][SYSTEM] don ’ t worry, Anna.

[SOC][USER] Why did you lie to me in the email ? [dialog_acts]question[SYSTEM] I didn't lie . You just didn't ask me my real name . [dialog_acts]inform[USER] I should have known it was you .

I would rather have a down-to-earth , honest and solid sales person than a painted , patent leather , designer suite salesman . [dialog_acts]inform[USER] It's not as simple as that . People judge you by your appearance , whether you like it or not . So dressing professional is being professional . The image that you portray to others is so important in business .

"[SOC][USER] Really ? Then I guess living together would be a good idea . [dialog_acts]question[SYSTEM] What do you mean ? [dialog_acts]question[USER] Well , these days too many people are getting divorced . If they live together , then at least they're finding out if they're really compatible or not . [dialog_acts]inform[EOC]","[SYSTEM] I guess so . Better to find out now than after you're married , when it's harder to get out . ",[SOR][SYSTEM] I don't know.
