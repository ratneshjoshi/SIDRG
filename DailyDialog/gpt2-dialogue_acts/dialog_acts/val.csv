[SOC][USER] Great ! I ’ ll take it . [dialog_acts]directive[SYSTEM] Here you are sir . Your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot .

[dialog_acts]commissive[EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] Have a great trip . [EOR]
[SOC][USER]I would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend . [dialog_acts]inform[SYSTEM] A trip to the beach would be fun . How is the weather going to be ? [dialog_acts]question[USER] The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend . [dialog_acts]inform[EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach ? [EOR]
[SOC][USER] The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend . [dialog_acts]inform[SYSTEM] So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach ? [dialog_acts]question[USER] It sounds like it will be . [dialog_acts]inform[EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] I really hope it doesn't get cold . [EOR]
"[SOC][USER] It sounds like it will be . [dialog_acts]inform[SYSTEM] I really hope it doesn't get cold . [dialog_acts]inform[USER] That would ruin things , I want to go so badly . [dialog_acts]inform[EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] The weather in California is unpredictable , so you never know . [EOR]"
"[SOC][USER] That would ruin things , I want to go so badly . [dialog_acts]inform[SYSTEM] The weather in California is unpredictable , so you never know . [dialog_acts]inform[USER] That is true . The weather is constantly changing . [dialog_acts]inform[EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] It would be nice if the weather would never change . [EOR]"

"[SOC][USER]Some companies use to ban dating among employees , but now they have realized it is something in avertable . People spend so much time at work . It is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other . [dialog_acts]inform[SYSTEM] If we think positively , office love can be beneficial to company . [dialog_acts]inform[USER] Beneficial ? I don ’ t think so . If two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . If they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . By any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating . [dialog_acts]inform[EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] But if two employees are in love , they will be happy . Happy people are more productive . If they develop an intimate relation with each other , they are willing to share knowledge and experience . It can help to improve work efficiency . [EOR]"
"[SOC][USER]Do you eat a lot of healthy food ? [dialog_acts]question[SYSTEM] Compared with healthy food , unhealthy food just tastes so much better .

I think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume . Some good things you should try are cranberry juice , wild rice and yoghurt . [dialog_acts]inform[EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] What's special about these things ? [EOR]"
"[SOC][USER] You have the point . I think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume . Some good things you should try are cranberry juice , wild rice and yoghurt . [dialog_acts]inform[SYSTEM] What's special about these things ? [dialog_acts]question[USER] Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic . Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice . Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled . [dialog_acts]inform[EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] Thanks . I'm going to follow your advice and pop down to the supermarket right now . [EOR]"

"[SOC][USER] Yes . I want to get a better job . [dialog_acts]inform[SYSTEM] Could you tell me why you want to quit ? [dialog_acts]question[USER] I quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues . [dialog_acts]inform[EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] Oh , that's terrible . Do you want to get a higher salary in our company ? [EOR]"
"[SOC][USER] I quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues . [dialog_acts]inform[SYSTEM] Oh , that's terrible .

"[SOC][USER]So , how should we get to the theatre ? [dialog_acts]question[SYSTEM] Let's take the bus . [dialog_acts]inform[USER] I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you . [dialog_acts]inform[EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] It's not that bad .

[dialog_acts]inform[EOC][SOR][SYSTEM] That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . [EOR]"
